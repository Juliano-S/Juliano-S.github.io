    <p>My reasoning for choosing ICT 
 I like to learn about computers and how they work, and I like to apply that knowledge by helping others and myself in related tasks,
 like working with JavaScript to update mods for videogames, or to troubleshoot computers for others.
 I have always had an interest in working with computers, from building and repairing pc's to just using them to play with my friends,
 and when I did that, I wondered "how does this simple piece of silicon and copper wire use and turn my input
into ones and zeros and those ones and zeros into an output?" 
        
 I started this study because I want to learn to design and build applications for myself and others and to learn more
 about the way computers work, I like to see and learn how a complex machine runs on a few simple instructions
 and well... works! I'm very curious and eager to learn and apply coding knowledge.</p>
