            <h2>My reasoning for choosing ICT</h2>
            <p>I like to learn about computers and how they work, and I like to apply that knowledge by helping others
                and myself in related tasks,
                like working with JavaScript to update mods for videogames, or to troubleshoot computers for others.
                I have always had an interest in working with computers, from building and repairing pc's to just using
                them to play with my friends,
                and when I did that, I wondered "how does this simple piece of silicon and copper wire use and turn my
                input
                into ones and zeros and those ones and zeros into an output?"</p>

            <p>I started this study because I want to learn to design and build applications for myself and others and
                to learn more
                about the way computers work, I like to see and learn how a complex machine runs on a few simple
                instructions
                and well... works! I'm very curious and eager to learn and apply coding knowledge.</p>
