    Why did I decide to study ICT at the HZ?<br>
    I decided to study ICT at the HZ because after attending several orientation days hosted by the HZ I found that I
    really like the environment
    that the school provides and the teachers that guide us through our study.
    But then you may ask "Why ICT?", well it's because I like to learn about computers and how they work
    and I like to apply that knowledge by helping others and myself in related tasks.
    Like working with JavaScript to update mods for videogames, or to troubleshoot computers for others.
    I have always had an interest in working with computers, from building and repairing pc's to just using
    them to play with my friends,
    and when I did that, I have often wondered "how does this simple piece of silicon and copper wire use and turn my
    input
    into ones and zeros and those ones and zeros into an output?"
    And over the course of this study we won't just learn how this works, we learn to use it too,
    which is why you can read this blog post right now!</p>

  <p class="studychoice">After completing this study:<br>
    While I am still unsure which corner of the ICT field I want to enter after this study,
    I am sure that I will find a field that will suit me.
    In the following years I hope to learn how to solve diverse ICT related tasks and to bring my own projects into
    reality using code.</p>
