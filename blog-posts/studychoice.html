    <h1>Study choice</h1>
    <p>I like to learn about computers and how they work, and I like to apply that knowledge by helping others
      and myself in related tasks,
      like working with JavaScript to update mods for videogames, or to troubleshoot computers for others.
      I have always had an interest in working with computers, from building and repairing pc's to just using
      them to play with my friends,
      and when I did that, I wondered "how does this simple piece of silicon and copper wire use and turn my
      input
      into ones and zeros and those ones and zeros into an output?"</p>
