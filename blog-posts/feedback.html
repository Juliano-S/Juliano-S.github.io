  <h1>First feedback</h1>

  <p class="feedbackFrans">The comment about ordered lists was made by Frans because I used an ordered list for the
    characteristics, <br>
    while not using numbers to order the items in the list.<br>
    I thought this feedback was warranted and fixed it by using an unordered list.<br>
    The comment about color was made by Frans because at the time my website was almost entirely grey-scale.<br>
    At the time I thought it looked good, but with time came the realisation that I could have done it better, <br>
    leading me to change the background and add more color.</p>

  <p class="feedbackAna">The comment about inline items was made by Anna because at the time i hadn't incorperated a lot
    of CSS into my site,<br>
    instead I used a lot of inline styling. Ana's advice for using less inline styling was very helpful in making my
    code more readable<br>
    and made it easier for me to maintain my code. </p>
